####The name of our project is simple - Chyrak.

We decided to combine the concepts of Art and Household items to design a pretty lampshade that diffuses the light that your lamp emits. <br/>

It is simple, yet useful, especially when you have a lonely lamp hanging down from the ceiling.

One of this lampshade's properties is its portability. You can easily remove from and put it on any lamp because of the hole at the top of our lampshade made for the lamp cable

Additionally, the lampshade is made out of the word "ALATOO", which is our university name. We could have designed simple holes, but we think that university name not only displays the originality of our project but also better diffuses the light from the lamp.<br/>

To make our project more aesthetic, we decided to design a couple of flowers, who doesn't like flowers after all?? 

These lotuses are imparted at 2 ports at the sides of our lampshade, and nuts are used to ensure the firm  attachment of the flowers to the lampshade.

This project has in total 5 pieces: 
* lampshade
* 2 lotus flowers with threads
* 2 nuts<br/>

1. Lampshade is designed in OpenScad and can be resized
1. Lotus flowers are inspired by the occurence of fibonacci pattern and golden ratio in the nature, and were designed in OpenScad as well.
1. Nuts are just typical nuts to firmly attach the flowers.

All in all, our project *Chyrak* is a piece of decor for a house. Instead of buying expensive chandeliers, one could simply print this lampshade in 3D printer as many pieces as he/she wants and attach it to the lamp. This lampshade can replace a chandelier and doesn't concede to any piece of lamp decoration.
